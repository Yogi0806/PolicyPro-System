# PolicyPro-System
PolicyPro – Spring Boot Insurance Management Platform
This project is a comprehensive insurance management system designed to streamline policy management, claims processing, and customer interactions. Built using Spring Boot and following the MVC architecture, it ensures efficient handling of insurance operations with a secure and scalable structure.

Key Features:
Admin Panel: Manages policies, claims, users, and payments with a role-based access system.
Policy & Claim Management: Enables users to purchase policies, file claims, and track claim status in real time.
Customer Portal: Allows users to manage policies, upload documents, and receive automated notifications.
Authentication & Authorization: Secure login with JWT-based authentication and Spring Security for role-based access control.

Developed a Spring Boot-based insurance management system with structured controllers, services, and repositories for modular data handling. Designed RESTful APIs to manage policy purchases, claim requests, and payments while integrating automated email notifications for policy renewals and claim updates. Utilized Hibernate with MySQL for secure data storage and optimized database performance. Ensured scalability by implementing service-layer abstractions for policy, claims, and customer operations. Integrated Maven for dependency management and Git for version control to maintain a well-structured codebase.

Technologies Used:
Back-End: Spring Boot, Java, JPA, Hibernate
Database: MySQL for secure insurance data storage
Security: JWT for authentication, Spring Security for role-based access
Build & Version Control: Maven, GitHub
Architecture: MVC, RESTful APIs

This project demonstrates expertise in Java Spring Boot development, focusing on policy management, claims processing, security, and API-driven architecture—a complete digital solution for modern insurance management.
